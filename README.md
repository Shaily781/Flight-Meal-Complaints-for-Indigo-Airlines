# ✈️ Indigo Airlines Meal Feedback Analysis
This project analyzes passenger feedback data collected from Indigo Airlines’ in-flight meal services. Airlines today compete not just on price or punctuality, but also on experience—and meals are a major part of that. Using Python and Pandas in Google Colab, this analysis uncovers key insights around vendor performance, frequent complaint routes, and repeat customer dissatisfaction.

# 🔍 Key Highlights:
Vendor Issues: TajSATS received the most complaints, especially for taste and packaging.

Route-Based Complaints: Routes like DEL-BLR and MAA-CCU showed higher dissatisfaction rates.

Packaging Concerns: Ratings under 3 were mostly linked to TajSATS.

Repeat Complainers: Identified a group of frequent flyers regularly providing negative feedback.

# 📌 Recommendations:
Conduct quality reviews for underperforming vendors.

Focus audits on packaging and hygiene.

Monitor high-complaint routes closely.

Proactively resolve issues from repeat complainants.
